To demonstrate the use of MPA recreational users’ KAP surveys, we present data collated from two boat ramp surveys of recreational fishers on Wadandi Country, conducted in 2019 (Navarro et al. 2021), and 2023 (unpublished). We draw on selected outputs from these surveys. 

An example of an MPA recreational users’ knowledge data output is displayed in Figure 3, which shows that in 2019, 12% of recreational fishers were aware of the Geographe or South-West Corner Marine Park. More recent surveys in 2023 show awareness has increased to 36%, representing a statistically significant increase (χ2 = 11.77, p &lt; 0.001). The low but improving awareness of these MPAs suggest that efforts to date aimed at increasing awareness have had a positive effect (e.g. boat ramp signage has been installed and zoning has been added to major boating apps in the region); however, significant progress is still to be made to match awareness of the adjacent state MPAs, measured at 81% in 2019 and 74% in 2023 (Navarro et al. 2021). To understand this difference in recreational fisher awareness, research could investigate the drivers of KAP and differences in management and communication between the MPAs. In turn, this could lead to MPA communication, education, and compliance management tailored to the user groups with the lowest awareness and targeted to high use areas evident from practice data. Similar trends over time can be inferred about changes in attitudes towards zoning and practices in MPAs as well (see examples in Appendix 6).

The relatively simple nature of MPA recreational users’ KAP surveys is both a strength and a limitation. As a limitation, the simplicity of the survey does not provide explanatory depth; for example, where negative attitudes are found, the survey will provide limited insights into why this attitude exists and other research tools will need to be deployed to understand underlying causes [(e.g., psychometric or qualitative research, Barclay et](https://paperpile.com/c/xVNHPN/BxMau/?prefix=e.g.%2C%20psychometric%20or%20qualitative%20research%2C) [al. 2017)](https://paperpile.com/c/xVNHPN/BxMau/?prefix=e.g.%2C%20psychometric%20or%20qualitative%20research%2C). As a strength, the simplicity of the survey makes it rapid, straightforward and relatively cheap to conduct and results are easily understood by managers. The quantitative outputs are easily communicable and consistency in the methodology supports comparative analysis across MPAs. As such, these strengths make MPA recreational users' KAP surveys highly applicable to aid MPA planning, for long-term monitoring within and across MPAs, and to inform management and research priorities.
